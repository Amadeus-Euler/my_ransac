## Disclaimer

This is a readme document for the users of automatic point cloud processing tools to characterize trees trunk diameters.

## Contents

The point cloud processing tools consist of a main script (run.m) and a group of functions. As an **input**, the tools require an individual tree point cloud. By default, the functions read .csv files. The **output** is the table - **fitdata**, which contain all the retained height-diameter pairs.

All of the parameters are likely to apply to trees with vertical, round and straight trunks, so there is no need to tune the parameters. For the non-vertical trees, the program will be improved later.
